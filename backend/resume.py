"""Turn a spoken interview into a structured, two-language worker profile."""

from . import llm
from .questions import LANGUAGES

SYSTEM = """You turn a spoken job interview with an Indian informal-sector worker \
(driver, electrician, cook, domestic worker, guard, tailor, etc.) into a resume.

The answers are speech transcripts: they may ramble, repeat, mix English trade \
words into another language, or contain small transcription errors.

Rules:
- Use only facts the worker actually said. Never invent employers, years, \
skills, certifications or pay. If something wasn't said, use null or [].
- Write with dignity and confidence, the way a good recruiter would present a \
skilled professional, but stay truthful and plain. No buzzwords, and no \
descriptive words the worker didn't use (don't turn "roti" into "soft rotis").
- Keep the worker's own level of claims. If they only understand a language \
a little, list it with that level, e.g. "English (basic understanding)".
- Convert spoken numbers to digits ("aath saal" -> 8).
- "native" fields are in the interview language, written in its own script. \
If the interview language is English, native fields repeat the English.
- speaker_gender: infer only from grammatical self-reference (e.g. Hindi \
"karta hoon" = male, "karti hoon" = female). Otherwise "unknown".
